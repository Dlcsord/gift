    <h1>Woah!</h1> <h3>You should be more careful next time! Your account could have been hacked!</h3>
    <h3>You are probably here thinking you got a free Nitro gift. That is not the case.</h3>
    <h3>But DO NOT worry! This website is NOT like most!
    <h3>Nitro scams often attempt to hack into your Discord account, steal your info and repost the very scam that you fell for!<br></h3>
    <h3>This website however is here to teach you how NOT to get scammed by the fake Discord Nitro Gifts.</h3>
    <br>
    <h3>The below image is what a REAL gift should look like.<br><img src="https://support.discord.com/hc/article_attachments/360100559094/Screen_Shot_2021-01-19_at_5.32.44_PM.png" alt="REAL Nitro gift!" width="747" height="269">
    </h3>
    <h3></h3>

    <h3>And below is an image showing what a FAKE gift can look like.<br><img src="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/507857234034819072/1027299442510020659/unknown.png?width=1025&height=362" alt="My FAKE Nitro gift!" width="747" height="269">
    </h3><h3>The differences in the above images may not seem obvious at first.</h3>
    <h3>Scams can look pretty convinving sometimes. Here are some things to look out for:
        <ul><li>Notice the button placement. (or is there a button at all?)</li><li>Discord Gifts are not just images! Only a portion of a gift is an image while the rest is made up of fancy website code.</li><li>Spelling mistakes. (not sure how often these occur.)</li><br>There could be other things that are off but i just named off a few!</h3></ul>
<h3>And here is the fake gift image that lured you here!<br><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/701516685164675153/1027319675987693568/gift2.png" alt="FAKE Nitro gift!" width="300" height="269">
</h3>        <h3>What's wrong with it?<ul><li>No button.</li><li>It's just an image.</li><li>It contains spelling mistakes.</li></h3></ul></h3>
<h3>Note: gifts can be layed out vertically. Gifts adjust themselves to fit your screen size.<br><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/701516685164675153/1027389262531923968/unknown.png" alt="Vertical Claimed Nitro gift!" width="269" height="400">
    <h3>I hope this website was at least somewhat helpful! And I hope you have a nice safe day on Discord!</h3>
